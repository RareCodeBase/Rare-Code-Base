      <h1>What is a ZIP Password Cracker?</h1>
      <p>
        A <strong>ZIP Password Cracker</strong> is a Python script or tool that helps you find the forgotten password of
        a ZIP file. If a ZIP file is protected with AES encryption, and you legally own it, you can try to recover the
        password using this method.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Use a ZIP Cracker?</h2>
      <p>
        If you've locked your own ZIP file and can't remember the password, you can try common passwords from a wordlist
        to recover it. This is known as a "dictionary attack."
      </p>

      <h2>Common Attack Methods</h2>
      <ul class="feature-list">
        <li><strong>Brute Force:</strong> Try all possible combinations (slow but effective).</li>
        <li><strong>Dictionary Attack:</strong> Try common passwords from a list.</li>
        <li><strong>Mask Attack:</strong> Try based on known patterns like "admin***" or "1234****".</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Python Script for AES ZIP Cracking</h2>
      <p>
        The Python script below uses the <code>pyzipper</code> module to check if passwords from a wordlist can unlock
        an AES-encrypted ZIP file.
      </p>

      <pre><code class="language-python"># Import the pyzipper module to handle AES-encrypted ZIP files
import pyzipper

# Import os module to work with the file system
import os

# Define a function to crack an AES ZIP file using a wordlist
def crack_aes_zip(zip_file_path, wordlist_path):
    # Step 1: Make sure the ZIP file exists
    if not os.path.exists(zip_file_path):
        print(f"[x] ZIP file not found: {zip_file_path}")
        return  # Exit the function if ZIP doesn't exist

    # Step 2: Check if the wordlist file exists
    if not os.path.exists(wordlist_path):
        print(f"[x] Wordlist file not found: {wordlist_path}")
        return  # Exit if the wordlist file is missing

    # Step 3: Read all passwords from the wordlist into a list
    with open(wordlist_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8', errors='ignore') as f:
        # Strip whitespace and skip blank lines
        passwords = [line.strip() for line in f if line.strip()]

    try:
        # Step 4: Open the ZIP file using pyzipper with AES decryption support
        with pyzipper.AESZipFile(zip_file_path) as zf:
            # Get a list of files inside the ZIP
            file_list = zf.namelist()

            # If ZIP has no files or is unreadable, exit
            if not file_list:
                print("[!] ZIP file is empty or has no readable entries.")
                return

            # Step 5: Try each password one by one from the wordlist
            for pwd in passwords:
                try:
                    # Set the password (must be bytes)
                    zf.pwd = pwd.encode('utf-8')

                    # Try opening the first file in the archive
                    with zf.open(file_list[0]) as f:
                        f.read(10)  # Read 10 bytes to test the password

                    # If no error occurs, password is correct
                    print(f"[+] Password found: {pwd}")
                    return True  # Stop after finding the right password

                except (RuntimeError, pyzipper.BadZipFile, ValueError):
                    # If password is wrong, continue trying
                    print(f"[-] Tried: {pwd}")
                except KeyboardInterrupt:
                    # If the user manually stops the script
                    print("[!] Interrupted by user.")
                    return

            # If all passwords failed
            print("[!] Password not found in wordlist.")
            return False

    except pyzipper.BadZipFile:
        # If the file is not a valid AES ZIP archive
        print("[x] Not a valid AES-encrypted ZIP file.")
        return

# === Start of the script ===

      <h2>Line-by-Line Code Explanation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>import pyzipper:</strong> A module that allows opening AES-encrypted ZIP files.</li>
        <li><strong>import os:</strong> Used to check if files exist before using them.</li>
        <li><strong>crack_aes_zip(...):</strong> Main function that attempts to find the password.</li>
        <li><strong>os.path.exists(...):</strong> Checks if ZIP and wordlist files are present.</li>
        <li><strong>with open(...):</strong> Reads passwords from the wordlist, removing blank lines.</li>
        <li><strong>pyzipper.AESZipFile(...):</strong> Opens the ZIP file using AES support.</li>
        <li><strong>namelist():</strong> Gets list of files inside the ZIP archive.</li>
        <li><strong>for pwd in passwords:</strong> Tries each password one by one.</li>
        <li><strong>zf.pwd = pwd.encode(...):</strong> Converts the password to byte format.</li>
        <li><strong>zf.open(...).read():</strong> Tries to read a few bytes using that password.</li>
        <li><strong>if success:</strong> The password is printed and process stops.</li>
        <li><strong>if fail:</strong> It prints that password was incorrect and continues.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Requirements</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><code>pip install pyzipper</code> â€” to install the ZIP library</li>
        <li>A wordlist file (like <code>wordlist.txt</code>)</li>
        <li>An AES-encrypted ZIP file</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Sample Wordlist</h2>
      <pre><code>1234
password
admin
letmein
qwerty
2024
</code></pre>

      <p>
        Only use this script on ZIP files you own or have permission to test. Unauthorized use is illegal and unethical.
