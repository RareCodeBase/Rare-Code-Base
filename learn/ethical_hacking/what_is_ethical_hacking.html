            <h1>What is Ethical Hacking?</h1>
            <p>Ethical hacking, also known as <strong>white-hat hacking</strong>, is the practice of legally breaking
                into
                systems to identify and fix security vulnerabilities. Unlike malicious hackers (<strong>black-hat
                    hackers</strong>),
                ethical hackers work to strengthen cybersecurity defenses. They use specialized tools and techniques to
                test system security before real threats can exploit them.</p>

            <h2>Why is Ethical Hacking Important?</h2>
            <p>Cyber threats are evolving every day, making security a top priority. Ethical hacking plays a crucial
                role in:</p>
            <ul class="feature-list">
                <li><strong>Preventing Cyberattacks:</strong> Identifies system weaknesses before malicious hackers can
                    exploit them.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Protection:</strong> Safeguards personal and sensitive information from breaches.</li>
                <li><strong>Building Trust:</strong> Companies with strong security gain customer confidence.</li>
                <li><strong>Compliance & Regulations:</strong> Helps organizations meet legal security standards like
                    GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How Ethical Hacking Works: A Step-by-Step Approach</h2>
            <p>Ethical hackers follow a structured methodology to secure systems:</p>
            <ul class="usage-list">
                <li><strong>Reconnaissance (Information Gathering):</strong> Collects data about the target system using
                    OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) techniques.</li>
                <li><strong>Scanning:</strong> Uses tools like Nmap, Nessus, and Wireshark to identify open ports and
                    vulnerabilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Exploitation:</strong> Attempts to exploit weaknesses using ethical hacking tools like
                    Metasploit and Burp Suite.</li>
                <li><strong>Privilege Escalation:</strong> Checks if a hacker can gain unauthorized access to
                    higher-level privileges.</li>
                <li><strong>Reporting & Fixing:</strong> Documents vulnerabilities and suggests security patches and
                    fixes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Applications of Ethical Hacking</h2>
            <p>Ethical hacking is used in various industries, including:</p>
            <ul class="usage-list">
                <li><strong>Banking & Finance:</strong> Protects financial transactions and prevents fraud.</li>
                <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Secures patient records and medical devices from cyber threats.</li>
                <li><strong>Government & Defense:</strong> Protects national security systems from cyber espionage.</li>
                <li><strong>Corporate IT:</strong> Ensures enterprise networks are resilient against attacks.</li>
                <li><strong>E-commerce:</strong> Prevents customer data leaks and payment fraud.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why Should You Learn Ethical Hacking?</h2>
            <p>With cybercrime on the rise, ethical hackers are in high demand. Here’s why it’s a great career choice:
            </p>
            <ul class="beginner-benefits">
                <li><strong>Job Opportunities:</strong> Growing demand in cybersecurity across all industries.</li>
                <li><strong>Attractive Salaries:</strong> Ethical hackers earn competitive salaries due to their
                    expertise.</li>

                <li><strong>Making the Internet Safer:</strong> Helps build a more secure digital world.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Ethical hacking isn’t just about breaking into systems—it’s about understanding cybersecurity at its
                core. If you love
                tech, solving problems, and want to make a difference, ethical hacking could be your perfect career
                path. Are you ready to become a white-hat hacker?</p>
