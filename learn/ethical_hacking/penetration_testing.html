            <h1>Penetration Testing Process</h1>
            <p>Pentesting is a systematic process used to simulate cyberattacks on systems, networks, or applications.
                The goal is to uncover weaknesses and help organizations fix them before real hackers exploit them.
                Below is the step-by-step process:</p>

            <h2>1. Planning and Reconnaissance</h2>
            <p>This is the homework phase of pentesting. You gather as much information as possible about the target.
                It’s like stalking (legally!) your crush on social media before asking them out.</p>
            <p><b>Activities:</b></p>
            <ul class="feature-list">
                <li><b>Define Scope:</b> Decide what’s being tested—network, application, or both.</li>
                <li><b>Understand Objectives:</b> Know the goals, such as identifying critical vulnerabilities.</li>
                <li><b>Collect Information:</b> Use tools like <b>WHOIS</b>, <b>Shodan</b>, and <b>Maltego</b> to map
                    the target’s landscape.</li>
                <li><b>Example:</b> Learning that the target uses outdated software versions or exposed subdomains.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Scanning</h2>
            <p>In this phase, you actively probe the system to identify vulnerabilities. It’s like testing every lock in
                a building to find the weak ones.</p>
            <p><b>Techniques:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Network Scanning:</b> Use tools like <b>Nmap</b> to identify live hosts and open ports.</li>
                <li><b>Vulnerability Scanning:</b> Tools like <b>Qualys</b> or <b>Nessus</b> help uncover outdated
                    software, weak configurations, or exploitable services.</li>
                <li><b>Example:</b> Discovering an open SSH port on an outdated version of Linux.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Gaining Access (Exploitation)</h2>
            <p>This is where the action happens! You attempt to exploit vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access. But
                remember—this is done with permission, so you’re more like a firefighter testing fire alarms.</p>
            <p><b>Tools:</b> <b>Metasploit</b>, custom exploit scripts, SQL injection techniques.</p>
            <p><b>Example:</b> Exploiting a buffer overflow in a vulnerable application to execute arbitrary code and
                gain admin rights.</p>

            <h2>4. Maintaining Access</h2>
            <p>Once inside, you try to establish a foothold to maintain long-term access. Think of it as secretly adding
                your name to the guest list of a club you just broke into (with consent!).</p>
            <p><b>Techniques:</b> Deploying backdoors or using tools like <b>Netcat</b> for persistent connections.</p>
            <p><b>Example:</b> Creating a reverse shell to access the system remotely whenever needed.</p>

            <h2>5. Post-Exploitation</h2>
            <p>Analyze the impact of the breach. What sensitive data can be accessed? What damage could be done? This is
                like checking how many valuables you could steal (hypothetically!) if you were a real attacker.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Tasks:</b> Extracting sensitive information, such as password hashes or financial records.</li>
                <li><b>Example:</b> Using <b>Mimikatz</b> to extract password hashes and credentials from memory.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Reporting</h2>
            <p>The final and most crucial step. Without a clear, actionable report, all the hacking is just for show.
                This is where you tell the client what’s broken and how to fix it.</p>
            <p><b>Contents of a Report:</b></p>
            <ul class="usage-list">
                <li><b>Findings:</b> A summary of vulnerabilities and exploited paths.</li>
                <li><b>Recommendations:</b> Steps to patch vulnerabilities and improve security.</li>
                <li><b>Proof of Concept:</b> Evidence like screenshots or logs to show successful exploitation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Example:</b> Highlighting that the client’s outdated web server allowed remote code execution.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Pentesting is like being a cyber ninja with a noble purpose. By following this methodology, ethical
                hackers ensure that systems are fortified against real-world attacks. So the next time you hear about
                penetration testing, just know it’s not just poking around—it’s saving the digital world!</p>
