      <h1>Modules and Packages in Python</h1>

      <p>In Python, code organization and reuse are made easy through <b>modules</b> and <b>packages</b>. These concepts
        help you break your code into manageable pieces, making it easier to maintain, test, and scale. Let's dive into
        both of them in simple terms.</p>

      <h2>What is a Module?</h2>

      <p>A <b>module</b> in Python is simply a file that contains Python code. It can define functions, classes,
        variables, and even runnable code. Once a module is created, you can import it into other Python programs to
        reuse its functionality. In simple words, a module is just a Python file that you can use to organize your code
        in a better way and make it reusable.</p>

      <h3>Example of a Python Module</h3>

      <p>Here’s an example of a simple Python module named <code>math_operations.py</code> that contains basic
        arithmetic operations:</p>

      <pre>
# math_operations.py
      
def add(a, b):
    return a + b  
      
def subtract(a, b):
    return a - b  
      
def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b  
      
def divide(a, b):
    if b == 0:  
        return "Cannot divide by zero!"  
    return a / b  
      </pre>

      <p>Once the module is created, you can import and use it in other Python scripts like this:</p>

      <h3>How to Use the Module in Another Python File</h3>

      <p>To use the <b>math_operations.py</b> module in a different Python script, you need to import it using the
        <code>import</code> keyword. Here's how you can do it:
      </p>

      <pre>
# main.py
      
import math_operations  
      
print(math_operations.add(5, 3))        
print(math_operations.subtract(10, 4))  
print(math_operations.multiply(4, 2))   
print(math_operations.divide(10, 2))    
      </pre>

      <p>In this example, after importing the module, you can directly use the functions defined in
        <code>math_operations.py</code> by calling them with the module name (e.g.,
        <code>math_operations.add(5, 3)</code>). This allows you to perform various operations like addition,
        subtraction, multiplication, and division.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Use Modules?</h2>

      <p>Modules are incredibly useful because they allow you to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Organize your code:</b> You can break your code into smaller parts, making it easier to understand and
          maintain.</li>
        <li><b>Reuse your code:</b> Once a module is written, you can reuse it in multiple projects or scripts without
          rewriting the same code again.</li>
        <li><b>Improve collaboration:</b> If you're working with a team, you can break your project into modules, and
          each person can work on a different part of the project without interfering with others.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to Create Your Own Module</h2>

      <p>Creating your own module is simple. You just need to:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Create a Python file with a .py extension (e.g., <code>math_operations.py</code>).</li>
        <li>Define functions, classes, or variables in that file.</li>
        <li>In another Python script, use the <code>import</code> statement to import and use the functions or classes
          you defined.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>In Python, modules help in organizing and reusing code in a more manageable way. By dividing your code into
        modules, you make your program more readable, maintainable, and scalable. Modules also allow you to avoid
        repeating code and encourage code reuse across multiple projects.</p>

      <h2>What is a Package?</h2>
      <p>A <b>package</b> is a collection of related modules. It’s essentially a folder (or directory) that contains
        multiple Python modules along with a special file called <code>__init__.py</code>, which tells Python to treat
        the directory as a package. A package helps in organizing the code in a structured way, especially when there
        are many modules.</p>

      <h3>Creating a Package</h3>
      <p>To create a package, you need a folder (directory) that contains multiple Python modules and an
        <code>__init__.py</code> file. The <code>__init__.py</code> file can be empty, but it must be present in the
        directory to let Python know that this folder is a package.
      </p>

      <p>Let’s say we are creating a package called <code>operations</code> that includes three modules:
        <code>addition.py</code>, <code>subtraction.py</code>, and <code>multiplication.py</code>. Here's how the folder
        structure will look:
      </p>

      <pre>
operations/
    __init__.py
    addition.py
    subtraction.py
    multiplication.py
        </pre>

      <p>Each module will have its own functionality, like this:</p>

      <h5>1. Addition Module (addition.py)</h5>
      <pre>
# operations/addition.py
        
def add(a, b):
    return a + b  
        </pre>

      <h5>2. Subtraction Module (subtraction.py)</h5>
      <pre>
# operations/subtraction.py
        
def subtract(a, b):
    return a - b  
        </pre>

      <h5>3. Multiplication Module (multiplication.py)</h5>
      <pre>
# operations/multiplication.py
        
def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b  
        </pre>

      <h3>Using the Package</h3>
      <p>Once the package is created, you can import the individual modules from the package and use the functions.
        Here's how you can import and use the functions from the package:</p>

      <pre>
# main.py
        
from operations.addition import add
from operations.subtraction import subtract
from operations.multiplication import multiply
        
print(add(5, 3))         
print(subtract(10, 4))   
print(multiply(4, 2))    
        </pre>

      <p>In this example, we imported each module (addition, subtraction, and multiplication) individually and used
        their functions.</p>

      <h3>Importing the Entire Package</h3>
      <p>You can also import the entire package and use the functions with the package name:</p>

      <pre>
# main.py
        
import operations.addition
import operations.subtraction
import operations.multiplication
        
print(operations.addition.add(5, 3))      
print(operations.subtraction.subtract(10, 4))  
print(operations.multiplication.multiply(4, 2)) 
        </pre>

      <p>In this case, we imported the entire package, and then we accessed the functions using the package name
        followed by the module name.</p>

      <h2>Using Built-in Modules and Packages</h2>
      <p>Python comes with many built-in modules that you can use without installing anything extra. These modules
        provide useful functionalities. For example, the <code>math</code> module provides mathematical functions, and
        the <code>os</code> module allows interaction with the operating system.</p>

      <h3>Example with Built-in Module</h3>
      <p>Here's how you can use the <code>math</code> module:</p>

      <pre>
import math
        
print(math.sqrt(16))    
print(math.factorial(5)) 
        </pre>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>In Python, <b>modules</b> and <b>packages</b> help you organize and reuse code. A <b>module</b> is a single
        Python file that contains related functions and variables, while a <b>package</b> is a collection of related
        modules stored together in a folder. Using packages and modules allows you to structure your code better, making
        it more manageable and reusable, especially for larger projects.</p>
