      <h1>Introduction to Wi-Fi Hacking</h1>

      <p>
        Wi-Fi hacking refers to the practice of identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in wireless networks for
        ethical or unauthorized purposes. Ethical hackers use these techniques to test network security and fix
        potential
        weaknesses before malicious attackers exploit them.
      </p>

      <h2>Understanding Wi-Fi Encryption Types</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy):</strong> An old and weak encryption method, easily broken with
          modern tools.</li>
        <li><strong>WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access):</strong> Improved over WEP, but still vulnerable with weak passwords.
        </li>
        <li><strong>WPA2:</strong> Most widely used today; secure if configured with a strong password.</li>
        <li><strong>WPA3:</strong> The latest and most secure standard, but not yet supported everywhere.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Common Wi-Fi Hacking Methods</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Packet Sniffing:</strong> Capturing packets from a network to analyze data or crack passwords.</li>
        <li><strong>Deauthentication Attack:</strong> Disconnecting devices from a Wi-Fi network to capture handshake
          packets.</li>
        <li><strong>Brute Force Attack:</strong> Trying many password combinations to gain access.</li>
        <li><strong>Evil Twin Attack:</strong> Creating a fake Wi-Fi access point to trick users into connecting.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Tools Commonly Used in Wi-Fi Hacking</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Aircrack-ng:</strong> Suite of tools for monitoring and cracking Wi-Fi networks.</li>
        <li><strong>Wireshark:</strong> Network packet analyzer to inspect traffic.</li>
        <li><strong>Reaver:</strong> Tool used to crack WPS-enabled routers.</li>
        <li><strong>Bettercap:</strong> Powerful network attack and monitoring tool.</li>
        <li><strong>Kismet:</strong> Wireless network detector and sniffer.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Legal and Ethical Use</h2>
      <p>
        Wi-Fi hacking should only be performed:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>In environments where you have explicit permission (e.g., a lab or authorized penetration test).</li>
        <li>For educational, research, or professional cybersecurity purposes.</li>
        <li>Never on networks that you do not own or have authorization to access. Unauthorized access is illegal and
          punishable by law.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Prerequisites and Best Practices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use a Linux-based system like Kali Linux that has hacking tools pre-installed.</li>
        <li>Ensure your wireless adapter supports monitor mode and packet injection.</li>
        <li>Understand basic networking concepts like IP addressing, MAC addresses, and protocols (TCP/UDP).</li>
        <li>Always log your tests and report vulnerabilities responsibly if working in an organizational environment.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Getting Started (Example Scenario)</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Open a terminal and check your wireless adapter:
          <pre><code>iwconfig</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>Enable monitor mode on your wireless interface (e.g., wlan0):
          <pre><code>airmon-ng start wlan0</code></pre>
          This will create a new interface like <code>wlan0mon</code>.
        </li>
        <li>Use airodump-ng to scan for nearby Wi-Fi networks:
          <pre><code>airodump-ng wlan0mon</code></pre>
          Note the BSSID (MAC address) and channel (CH) of the target network.
        </li>
        <li>Focus on a specific network and capture the handshake:
          <pre><code>airodump-ng --bssid [Target-BSSID] -c [Channel] -w capture wlan0mon</code></pre>
          Replace <code>[Target-BSSID]</code> and <code>[Channel]</code> with the actual values.
        </li>
        <li>Open another terminal to send deauthentication packets to force a device to reconnect:
          <pre><code>aireplay-ng --deauth 10 -a [Target-BSSID] wlan0mon</code></pre>
          This helps capture the handshake when a device reconnects.
        </li>
        <li>Once the handshake is captured (you'll see "WPA handshake" at the top of airodump-ng), use aircrack-ng with
          a wordlist:
          <pre><code>aircrack-ng -w /path/to/wordlist.txt -b [Target-BSSID] capture-01.cap</code></pre>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        If the password is in the wordlist, aircrack-ng will reveal it. This example assumes you are working in a legal
        and ethical testing environment. Never perform these steps on unauthorized networks.
      </p>


      <p>
        This is a simplified example of how penetration testers evaluate wireless network security. Always act
        responsibly and within the boundaries of the law.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Wi-Fi hacking plays a crucial role in cybersecurity when used ethically. By learning how attackers exploit
        weaknesses, you can better protect wireless networks from real-world threats. Continue learning, but always
        follow legal and ethical guidelines.
