      <h1>History of Python</h1>
      <p>Python is a popular programming language that was created in the late 1980s. Despite its name, Python is not
        named after a snake but after a British comedy TV show called "Monty Python's
        Flying Circus."</p>

      <h2>How Did Python Start?</h2>
      <p>Python was created by <strong>Guido van Rossum</strong> in 1989 while he was working at <strong>CWI (Centrum
          Wiskunde & Informatica)</strong> in the Netherlands. His goal was to build a programming language that:</p>
      <ul class="feature-list">
        <li><strong>Simple and Readable:</strong> Easy to learn for beginners and capable of solving complex problems.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Versatile:</strong> Could be used for various tasks, like web development, data analysis, and
          automation.</li>
        <li><strong>Powerful:</strong> Useful for advanced programming tasks as well.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Python Versions</h2>
      <p>Over the years, Python has evolved through multiple versions, becoming more efficient and feature-rich. Here
        are some key milestones in Python's journey:</p>
      <ul class="usage-list">
        <li><strong>Python 0.9.0 (February 1991):</strong> The first public release included features like:
          <ul>
            <li>Functions and exception handling</li>
            <li>Core data types like lists, dictionaries, and strings</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Python 1.0 (January 1994):</strong> The first stable version with new features like:
          <ul>
            <li>Functional programming tools - <code>lambda</code>, <code>map()</code>, <code>filter()</code>, and
              <code>reduce()</code>
            </li>
            <li>Improved exception handling</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Python 2.0 (October 16, 2000):</strong> Introduced major new features:
          <ul>
            <li>List comprehensions (borrowed from Haskell)</li>
            <li>Garbage collection with reference counting and cycle detection</li>
            <li>Unicode support</li>
          </ul>
          <p><em>Python 2.x series support ended on January 1, 2020.</em></p>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Python 3.0 (December 3, 2008):</strong> A major update with modern syntax and improved consistency:
          <ul>
            <li><code>print</code> became a function instead of a statement</li>
            <li>Unification of <code>str</code> and <code>unicode</code></li>
            <li>Type annotations for better code clarity</li>
          </ul>
          <p><em>Python 3.x is the current version series used today.</em></p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why is Python Special?</h2>
      <p>Here are some reasons why Python is so popular:</p>
      <ul class="beginner-benefits">
        <li><strong>Human-Friendly Syntax:</strong> Python code looks similar to plain English, making it easy to
          understand.</li>
        <li><strong>Community Support:</strong> Python has a massive community that helps beginners learn and grow.</li>
        <li><strong>Rapid Growth:</strong> Python is widely used in fields like AI, Machine Learning, and Web
          Development.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Today, Python is one of the most powerful and widely used programming languages, perfect for both beginners and
        experienced developers!</p>
