      <h1 class="mb-4">Linux Privilege Escalation</h1>
      <p>Privilege escalation means getting more access or control over a system than you’re supposed to have. In Linux, it usually means going from a normal user to the root user — the one who has full power over everything.</p>

      <h2 class="mt-5">What is Privilege Escalation?</h2>
      <p>When someone breaks out of their limited user role and gets higher permissions, like root access, it’s called privilege escalation. It’s a key concept in ethical hacking and real-world cyber attacks.</p>

      <h2 class="mt-4">Types of Privilege Escalation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Vertical Escalation:</strong> Going from a normal user to an admin or root user.</li>
        <li><strong>Horizontal Escalation:</strong> Accessing another user’s data or files without having higher privileges.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="mt-4">Why It Matters in Cybersecurity</h2>
      <p>Privilege escalation is important for both hackers and defenders:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hackers:</strong> Use it to gain control over systems and do more damage or exploration.</li>
        <li><strong>Security Experts:</strong> Learn these techniques to detect and fix security flaws before attackers can use them.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="mt-4">Common Techniques Used in Linux</h2>
      <p>Here are some popular methods attackers use to escalate privileges in Linux systems:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>SUID Binaries</li>
        <li>Sudo Misconfigurations</li>
        <li>Kernel Exploits</li>
        <li>Weak File Permissions</li>
        <li>PATH Variable Abuse</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="mt-3">In this series, we'll explain each technique step-by-step, with real examples and how to defend against them. Whether you're just starting out or brushing up your skills — you're in the right place.</p>
